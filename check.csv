My boyfriend bought the camera and a pack of film from the Polaroid website. The film pack came with it was recently produced, just a month away from the production date.I ordered my next pack of film right away from Amazon because of excitement. After seeing many reviews concerning about expired films, I got worried. The package arrived today, just in time for me to test it. I noticed that the production date is more than two months, older than what my boyfriend ordered from their website. The images came out great.Although the films are good, no concerns for now, moving forward I will order straight from their website to ensure the freshest patchs of exposure. Plus, they have a reward system so I can redeem coupons in the future."

4,Genevieve,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFQKCDRXJXNQI4WQVC5BNCPQYBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4.0,Expensive but I still enjoy it,"I wish they weren’t SO expensive. You have to use the entire thing, before switching. If you want to try a different color before it’s out, it will spit out one and waste it when you put it back in. A few of mine had discolored spots. Not to upset since it’s a vintage style picture anyways."
5,J. Kruse,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVITRMQ6OWB6D6VC4X5MWASSBJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5.0,Don’t buy here!,"This film is great, and you can get some really cool shots with it - however, you should buy it directly from Polaroid! Amazon sent me a pack that was months old, had not been stored properly, and the box looked like it had been smashed in transit (they packed it in a bubble envelope). This resulted in photos that came out washed out and did not develop evenly. Worst of all, a couple shots leaked chemicals all over the inside of the camera. So 5 stars for the film generally, zero stars for Amazon’s ability to properly sell it."

7,Danielle,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYWD7GRS4ZBEQE4Q4PUJK5DKXSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4.0,Good photo,Picture quality is good for a Polaroid. I like the concept of a Polaroid more than the picture quality. Make sure you have good lighting and you hide it from light directly after and you get a good picture.

We used this to rise Polaroids at our destination wedding and it was perfect.

They really make the pictures pop. It comes out in a random order but I haven't found any colors I don't like. Worth the money.

However, I was upset that the packaging seemed like it was beaten down. I didn’t return it though because I needed to capture some memories for my daughter’s birthday. Some films has a bad print, I just kept the good ones."
