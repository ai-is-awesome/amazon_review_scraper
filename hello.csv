Perfect timing!  I have a heavy-duty blender that I love, but it is big, and I cannot leave it on my counter.  It's a bit of a nuisance to pull it out of the cabinet when I'm making a smoothie for just me.  This personal-sized blender is perfect for an individual drink (or two smaller drinks, using the larger mixing cup!).  I quickly made an orange drink slushy with about a cup of ice and a cup of water.  The ice was completely pulverized in just about ten seconds.  When my son made his mocha freeze, he ran it for about 20 seconds, and pulsed it a couple of times.  Both drinks were SUPER smooth!  I was very impressed with the blender's ability to blend the ice so finely!  The instructions say the unit may turn off if you let it run too long (maybe four minutes?), I don't know why it would take that long to blend anything, though!Before I used it, I quickly washed it with hot water and soap.  I was very pleasantly surprised that it cleaned up so very well after use, as well.  No greasy residue from the dairy in the mocha drink.  The plastic is perfectly clear, so you can always see what's going on in the cup while it is blending.To top it off, each of the blending cups come with a flip travel lid.  These DO NOT LEAK!!!  I've seen other brands of personal blenders that cost MUCH more...I'm glad I bought this one instead of one of those!  Why pay more if you don't have to?"
1,Teresa S.,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHOWROIIEJFUMK4UY4DQTLL4G2HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5.0,Works Pretty Good,"The blender works pretty good. The only thing is when I used some frozen strawberries and blueberries I had to blend twice to get it to not have any chunks. That is not bad for a compact blender like this. Also, I had to hit my cup a a few times and shake a little to make sure the contents were being blended properly. The blade seemed to nof blend it much so had to blend a 2nd time for under a minute like instructions state. Overall, not a bad blender. I like that it comes with 2 cups! The blender has 3 levels of blending is cool also. Not a bad purchase. Looking forward to take this when I travel. It is very like looking...the dark red."

And this one fit just what I was looking for. The blender itself is a small size and doesn't have any extra cups you put on it along with having to pour it in another cup to drink out of. Huge plus because less space and even better less dishes! You just take it off, flip it right side up, unscrew it and put on the lid to drink out of and walk out the door. I used it to make milkshakes with fruit and I couldn't even get a picture of it in progress because I had 2 little kids excited and couldn't even take a picture after they were done because they drank it up within minutes. I love how there is a protector on the plug too helps keep it safe from water or anything else that night bend it. The different speeds are great to use it to get the consistency you want for what you are blending. I highly recommend this blendee!"

I could not be happier with this product. The blender was packaged very well and came with a large and small bottle and an extra gasket. A couple of summers ago, I made smoothies daily using a commercial grade blender. It is big and bulky and I no longer wanted it on my counter.  Yesterday, I took this blender out of the box, washed the components and proceeded to prepare a smoothie. This blender is fast. It is powerful. It crushes ice cubes easily! I used greens, fruit, greek yogurt, water and six ice cubes. I had a perfectly blended smoothie in less than one minute. I cleaned up the bottle and made a second one for my husband right away.Everything cleans up easily. The size is perfect and I can pop this in and out of a drawer readily. I cannot recommend this enough.  Comes with a two year warranty that can be extended with product registration. If you like smoothies, give this blender a try."

But I admit I'm too lazy to get out my big blender each time then clean it afterwards.  I LOVE this blender! So convenient to use.  Just put everything in the stirring cup, blend,  then drink right from the stirring cup on the go. It's so nice that it's dishwasher safe,  too. This seriously saves so much of my time."

It easily fits on the counter and looks much more expensive than it is with the matte red color. It’s easy to clean and has the same type of blade at the bottom, just like my huge, name brand blender, but I’ll actually use this! The time to assemble and clean the box blender made us not use it. This one will get daily use."

It effortlessly blends frozen fruit for my smoothie. It did so at all speeds. Since it's compact, it stores very easily, though the matte burgundy body is attractive enough to leave out on the counter.Convenient: The handles on the bottle lids come in handy for portability. I make breakfast smoothies for the family early in the morning, and store the portable bottles in the fridge. They take up very little room.My only wish is that it came with more than two bottles. I'd love to be able to buy extra/replacement bottles. Hope that's will be available soon!"

I have a Nutri Ninja, and this is a rival. If I did not already have my blender, I would be buying this for myself as well. She was very happy with this one. One thing that used to keep me from making more protein smoothies is the fact that we had a full-sized blender and I hated having to wash it after each use. I do not always have enough dishes to run the dishwasher daily, so I would end up hand washing the glass container & it was a pain. This morning, I added crushed ice, water, chocolate protein powder, a banana, & almond butter and pressed the button. Within seconds, it was all blended perfectly and ready to drink. They do not leak at all. I'm impressed that the rubber grommets are easy to remove to easily clean. And it came with spare grommets too! After it was finished, I removed the cup from the base and drank my drink. I am really surprised at how powerful it is for being small. Great product if you make smoothies daily."

So glad I did, because it has met my expectations so far! Decided to go big from the beginning -- frozen bananas, blueberries, Greek yogurt & oatmilk -- for a thick, creamy and healthy dessert. The compact blender is cute (and perfectly sized for a single serving, or bigger for two), super easy to use, and surprisingly quick and quiet. I foresee expanding my breakfast options with some delicious smoothies1"

The first two gave up, and I wanted to try out something nice. I trust the brand, as I already have purchased a couple of other items. This blender looks so good on my countertop, and the dualtone color is just perfect. I am very pleased with how powerful it is. I can make smoothies that are truly pulverized. It comes with 2 jars, both for adult size and kids size.I am used to using a large sized blender container, so I like that, but I also really like that I can make a smoothie for one - and drink it out of the container! I also like how easy this is to clean.I’m very pleased with this machine and would highly recommended it."

This is comforting to know when deciding how much I can blend at one time. I also love the burgundy color which looks better than what I had expected (thought this item was red).The blender itself is user friendly. I had no real issues with set up and blending all of the items together. Also adore the dial feature - you can chose either 1 (low) or 2 (high) for power.I blended a banana smoothie (1 cup ice, 2 tblspn sugar, 1/2 banana and 1 cup milk). As you can see in the attached pics, this compact blender did the job. The only hiccup I had was that I needed to shake the bottle half way through because the bottom of the cup (before turning bottle upside down to blend) froze quickly so this part did not blend until I shook the bottle half way (temp shut off power 1st) through the blending. Otherwise, a very nice blender."

I have one of the big brand name blenders and this gives it some competition. I like the size, the quaintness of it and the two on the go bottles it comes with. I already made a smoothie with some kale,  almond milk, half a banana and some blueberries and it did its thing. Clean up is a breeze and doesn't take a lot to wash the motor cover and bottle, much easier to clean than the brand name. My 14 year old made her own smoothie which she's never done with the other one. I discovered this company right before Christmas and am impressed with my purchases. The price for this blender is definitely worth it. No regrets!"

I like the two container sizes it comes with and I really like the color. It's pretty!! The containers are nice and clear and have measurements on the sides.I used it right after I took the pictures and it is so easy to use. So so easy to clean and doesn't take up a lot of space for storage. I named it Red....Red it really strong and in no time I had a great smoothie.

   This blender is easy to clean and very powerful! The blender comes with 3 speeds that you can use for different ingredients or make the texture of the smoothies to your liking. I love that the bottle size is big enough for the blender yet convenient when you can just take it with you. It comes with a replacement seal ring in the package which is very thoughtful. In the user manual, there are several smoothies recipes you can use right away! I tried the berry and tropical smoothies recipes which I definitely recommend :D"
27,Amazon Customer,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5LYDORWWF74FTMI74I4AMTZSFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5.0,Worth the $32,"This blender is an inexpensive compact catch for the consumer.  I did 3/4 C frozen blueberries, 1/4 frozen banana, 3/4 C almond milk, 3 T of oats, 1 T of hemp, and kale.  The liquid, was trapped in the frozen blueberries at the top.  So I had to loosen the milk by stirring with a spoon.  Then I used P mode to grind the big chunks and then switched to the high.  I had to shake and repeat twice.  You wouldn’t have to do that with fresh fruit, I’m sure. The only other thing that happened is the blade became stuck in the bottom, not sure if that’s user fault, however, I had to screw an empty bottle on and press down to loosen the blade.  It comes with 1 large bottle and one small. Overall, this is a great item for the cost.  HadinEEon keep making these great gadgets!"

I'm always hesitant to trust that a smoothie machine will blend all of the ingredients into a nice texture and blend with no troubles. I was very excited to see that this smoothie machine went right to work and just a minute later, I had already made the first two smoothies for my kids. It's easy to clean, the bottles are portable because they come with lids, and the dials are easy to understand. Definitely recommend!"

Second item I got from this brand and both are attractive sitting on the counter, feel as if they are well made and easy to operate. was surprised how easily this small unit made my go to shake - ice, frozen fruit, protein powder and peanut butter made it quick - no jamming...

It’s a good countertop blender, well made with good quality materials and several very useful features, and really nice looking (I love the brushed steel red finish on the body). It comes with two bottles that you fill with things to be blended, cover with the blades top, and screw onto the base machine to turn on. I’ve made fruit/yogurt/spinach smoothies easily. A couple of berries were left intact, but I only turned it on to the first level of power (there are three). It is important to include some liquid to get a smooth blend. The BPA-free (says this on the bottom) plastic bottles have lids for portability. I will use it a lot."

Attractive out on counter if you like. Blends well... I even include carrots in my daily smoothies.

I already had a Ninja Auto IQ blender; it's very powerful but very loud. I wanted something a bit smaller and more quiet. After looking around I found this product and so far I'm very satisfied. I've been using it every day and it's worked great so far.It's so much more quiet and I plan to take it with me when travelling gets better so I can keep making healthy drinks. Highly recommended.

First omg this blender is beautiful. This is the third smoothie blender (final) I’m buying off Amazon and let me tell you this one is perfect. Noise level- almost zero compared to the ones I have bought in the past. It was so low I thought it wasn’t working Lol but obviously, it was.

You have to bang the cup and take it off the motor to shake it. My blade attachment actually got stuck in the motor so I returned it. Before I had a malfunction with my machine I wrote a 4 star review because I was told if I wrote a review at all I would get a $15 gift card so I was honest. I was just emailed and told that if I changed my review to 5 stars I would get an additional $5 as a 4 star “looks bad for business”. Don’t be fooled by all the 5 star reviews it’s just a cheap blender.
